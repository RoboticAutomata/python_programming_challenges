# Python Programming Challenges

This repo demonstrates how to solve programming problems using Python.

## Fizz Buzz

For now, this repo will likely only solve the Fizz Buzz problem. Perhaps in the future we may implement more programming solutions. 

## Run the tests

Assuming you're on a bash based terminal:

```bash
pytest --doctest-modules fizz_buzz.py 
```
